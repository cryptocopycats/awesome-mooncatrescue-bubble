# Awesome MoonCatRescue Bubble (Anno 2021)

25,600 MoonCats on the Blockchain - World's 1st On-Chain Generative Crypto Art - An Insanely Cute Rescue Operation


> MoonCatRescue is an exploration of user-discoverable blockchain assets.
> Users "mine" for MoonCats in their browser.
> After MoonCats are "mined", they can be put up for adoption, adoptions can be requested, they can be given away,
> and they can be permanently named.

Launched in August 2017 by Ponderware with 25,600 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to rescue, pre the ERC721 standard.

twitter: [ponderware](https://twitter.com/ponderware),
reddit: [MoonCatRescue](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonCatRescue/)




Note: Genesis cats (256 max.) are not "rescued" but rather "released" by the contract owners.
If those original project owners re-emerge, they'd have the ability to release more Genesis cats.

2nd oldest digitial collectible¹ on the (ethereum)  blockchain
rediscovered after four years
and 100% rescued ("mined") during 4 hours of craze today.
The project died after a bug in the contract
that locked the raised fund mid 2017.

- CryptoPunks -
- MoonCats -       Aug 9, 2017
- CryptoKitties -  Nov 28, 2017


> MoonCatRescue has been added to the [Non-fungible Token Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token).
> MoonCat is the 2nd NFT collection to ever exist on the Ethereum blockchain,
> it was only discovered 10 hours ago after being forgotten about for nearly 4 years.

MoonCats Facts

1. Founder unknown/disappeared. Just like Satoshi for #Bitcoin
2. Second oldest collectible on Ethereum after CryptoPunks
3. Only 25,600 in existence
4. Required CPU power and manual work -> No whales
5. Immense history value -> collectibles rescued after 4 years
6. CryptoKitties contract submitted on Nov 28, 2017, MoonCats contract submitted on Aug 09, 2017. This makes them first cats in NFT existence.
7. You can name them. And that was possible FOUR years before Hashmasks!

## Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Corner - The Original Mooncat Pixel Drawing Tool Online

The Mooncat developers (Ponderware) write:

> Here is the tool we wrote and used to generate the MoonCatRescue pixel art.
> There has been some interest in knowing how we drew them, so we figured we might as well release it.
> Prepare to be underwhelmed!  => [**mooncatrescue.com/pixeleditor**](https://mooncatrescue.com/pixeleditor)


A little tip if you try it out online - there are [128 original mooncat pixel drawings / designs](DESIGNS.md)
(all encoded in the original source code in a single-line string - see [`designs.rb`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cryptocopycats/mooncats/master/lib/mooncats/designs.rb) for a "word-wrapped" more readable
source of the original example.

Yes, you can read in the design into the pixel drawing tool online  (reformat required - every pixel row must be on its own line
and all (color) numbers space separated). Example for design 0:

Paste the text into the box below the pixel grid canvas and click on the read button.
