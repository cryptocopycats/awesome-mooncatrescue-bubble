# Awesome MoonCatRescue Bubble (Anno 2021)

25,600 MoonCats on the Blockchain - World's 1st On-Chain Generative Crypto Art - An Insanely Cute Rescue Operation


> MoonCatRescue is an exploration of user-discoverable blockchain assets.
> Users "mine" for MoonCats in their browser.
> After MoonCats are "mined", they can be put up for adoption, adoptions can be requested, they can be given away,
> and they can be permanently named.

Launched in August 2017 with 25,600 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to rescue, pre the ERC721 standard.

Note: Genesis cats (?? max.) are not "rescued" but rather "released" by the contract owners. 
If those original project owners re-emerge, they'd have the ability to release more Genesis cats.

2nd oldest digitial collectible¹ on the (ethereum)  blockchain
rediscovered after four years 
and 100% rescued ("mined") during 4 hours of craze today.
The project died after a bug in the contract 
that locked the raised fund mid 2017.

MoonCats Facts

1. Founder unknown/disappeared. Just like Satoshi for #Bitcoin 
2. Second oldest collectible on Ethereum after CryptoPunks
3. Only 25,600 in existence
4. Required CPU power and manual work -> No whales
5. Immense history value -> collectibles rescued after 4 years
6. CryptoKitties contract submitted on Nov 28, 2017, MoonCats contract submitted on Aug 09, 2017. This makes them first cats in NFT existence.
7. You can name them. And that was possible FOUR years before Hashmasks!
