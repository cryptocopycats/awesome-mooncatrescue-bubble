# Awesome MoonCatRescue Bubble (Anno 2021)



25,600 MoonCats on the Blockchain - World's 1st On-Chain (Verified) Generative Crypto Art - An Insanely Cute Rescue Operation


> MoonCatRescue is an exploration of user-discoverable blockchain assets.
> Users "mine" for MoonCats in their browser.
> After MoonCats are "mined", they can be put up for adoption, adoptions can be requested, they can be given away,
> and they can be permanently named.

Launched in August 2017 by Ponderware with 25,600 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to rescue, pre ERC-721 standard.

Note: Genesis cats (256 max.) are not "rescued" but rather "released" by the contract owners.
If those original project owners re-emerge, they'd have the ability to release more Genesis cats.

The project died after a bug in the contract
that locked ("burned") the raised funds via genesis cats releases / adoptions mid 2017.

> and maximize the enjoyment of all mooncat rescuers.
> Note: we don't receive any compensation for new genesis cats.
> We were supposed to but, well, check the FAQ.

## Mooncat Rescue Day - Friday, March 12, 2021 - Mooncat Mania History

> Lost cat: found.
>
> Since the front-end interface of MoonCatRescue.com had long been
> defunct, dedicated non-fungible token (NFT) fans
> had to manually interact with the contract using Etherscan
> to rescue the cats. It didn't take long before detailed
> instructions were circulating...



> Mooncats look like the 2nd oldest¹ NFTs on Ethereum...
>
> How to claim for free?
>
> 1. Find Cats https://mooncatrescue.com/scan.html
> 2. Record seed and ID
> 3. https://etherscan.io/token/0x60cd862c9c687a9de49aecdc3a99b74a4fc54ab6#writeContract
> 4. Connect @MetaMask
> 5. RescueCat() enter seed
> 6. Pay Gas    [Should be like $25-35 else it is wrong.]
> HODL Your Mooncat
>

2nd oldest digitial collectible on the (ethereum) blockchain
rediscovered after four years
and 100% rescued ("mined") during 4 hours of craze today.

MoonCats rescued by year:

| Year | Count |
|------|-------|
| 2017 |  3365  (13.23%) |
| 2018 |  2319  ( 9.12%) |
| 2019 |    71  ( 0.28%) |
| 2020 |     3  ( 0.01%) |
| 2021 | 19682  (77.37%) |


Resulting in 19 681 MoonCats (77.36%) rescued on March 12, 2021 - if you compare to 492 (1.93%) rescued on August 10, 2017 - the launch day -
and 412 (1.62%) on launch day+1, and 229 (0.90%) on launch day+2.

The Mooncat could get rescued for "free" on March 12, 2021 - paying only the transaction gas fee about $25-35 at the time resulting in a gold rush for miners raking in about $600 000 in a couple of hours.

> Outside of the ~0.025 ETH gas fee, these cats were free to mint

>
> immediately after all the cats were rescued,

## Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Corner - The Original Mooncat Pixel Drawing Tool Online

The Mooncat developers (Ponderware) write:

> Here is the tool we wrote and used to generate the MoonCatRescue pixel art.
> There has been some interest in knowing how we drew them, so we figured we might as well release it.
> Prepare to be underwhelmed!  => [**mooncatrescue.com/pixeleditor**](https://mooncatrescue.com/pixeleditor)


A little tip if you try it out online - there are [128 original mooncat pixel drawings / designs](DESIGNS.md)
(all encoded in the original source code in a single-line string - see [`designs.rb`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cryptocopycats/mooncats/master/lib/mooncats/designs.rb) for a "word-wrapped" more readable
source of the original example.

Yes, you can read in the design into the pixel drawing tool online  (reformat required - every pixel row must be on its own line
and all (color) numbers space separated). Example for design 0:

> With a maximum cap of 25,600 discoverable pixelated cats, MoonCats easily fulfilled both criteria for a potential goldmine.
